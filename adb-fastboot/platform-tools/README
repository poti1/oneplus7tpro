      TWRP.img     -> twrp-3.6.1_11-0-hotdog.img
   - Create COPY_TO_DOWNLOADS folder:
      app-debug.apk (Magisk) from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/topjohnwu/magisk-files/canary/app-debug.apk
      boot -> ../STOCK/images/boot.img

         payload-dumper-go_1.2.0_linux_amd64/payload-dumper-go
      - Rename extracted folder to:
         STOCK

This will change to a custom ROM (LineageOS):
   https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/hotdog/#supported-models

This will restore OnePlus 7T Pro to Stock Rom (Optionally Root):
   - Create boot.img patch file (If Rooting):
      https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/working-safetynet-with-pixel-6-pro-android-12.4354149/
         - Use Magisk to create magisk_patched-*.img from boot.img
         - Copy patch file to STOCK/images/
   - Flash the stock ROM (OOS latest version)
         cd STOCK
         adb reboot fastboot
         FLASH_STOCK.sh    # --slot=all only works when in recovery->fastboot
   - Do a full factory reset through the TWRP recovery
         fastboot boot TWRP.img
         # Wipe -> All options.
   - Flash stock boot.img
         adb reboot fastboot
         fastboot flash --slot=all boot boot.img
   - Flash custom boot if (If Rooting):
         ROOT.sh
   - Again enter recovery mode in stock recovery. Do a full wipe.
         fastboot reboot recovery
         # Wipe -> All options.
   - Now lock the bootloader (unless Rooting):
         fastboot oem lock --skip-reboot 
   - Reboot to enter stock recovery and wipe all again
         fastboot reboot recovery
         # Wipe -> All options.
   - Reboot
         This may require a factory reset if you get put into 'Data may be corrupted'
   - Copy 'COPY_TO_DOWNLOADS' to downloads.
   - Pass SafetyNet Checks (If Rooting):
      - Magisk Manager -> Direct Install
      - Reboot device
      - In Magisk Manager, go to the Settings and enable Zygisk and Enforce DenyList
      - Configure DenyList:
         com.google.android.gms
         com.google.android.gms.unstable
      - In Magisk Settings, choose to Hide the Magisk app.
      - Reboot your device and test SafetyNet with an app like YASNAC
      - If you're still failing CTS, you can try to clear app data for:
         Google Play Services
         Play Store
